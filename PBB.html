    <p>Tender peanut butter cookies, made from scratch in a recipe that comes together quickly, are the base that sets
        the standard. Once they’re out of the oven, Hershey's Kisses are immediately pressed into the warm cookies so
        that the dough cradles the candy and holds it in place. Once they’re cooled and ready to eat, they’re the
        perfect combination of silky chocolate and tender, sweet-salty peanut butter cookie—and you’d better believe
        they’ll disappear fast!</p>
